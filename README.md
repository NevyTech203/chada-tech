How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The way I interpret what a user needs for their program is by analysing the system. I would achieve this through my own analysis or through feedback from a team member. Users stories helped with this through the real world experience on how to relay information to someone who is not tech savy,  as well as gaining a deeper understanding on their wants and perspective.  

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Through my readings and understanding of the process works for developing a program, the only approach suitable is an agile approach. A waterfall approach would be careless and lazy. I would benefit from having a more flexible strategy with testing, planning, and informing the client. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member means understanding you part of the project and completeing it in a timly mannor. Not lagging behind and keeping the rest of the team informed on any struggles, accomplishes, or changes... As well as listening to on another, especially if they need help.
